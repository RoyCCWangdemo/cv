              <h2>My experiences</h2>
              <p class="intro">I have experience with devising and applying advanced algorithms to solve real-world problems. I have taken on the following types of projects: research & development of products, strategic consultation, research study design, data analysis, literature/document review, generic troubleshooting, scientific or statistical software work, scientific/technical presentations, and educational workshops.<br><br>
            
                For projects with software deliverables: I have developed complete Julia/Python packages, Jupyter notebooks, and low-complexity web services.</p><br><br>

              <h2>Specialists need their tools</h2>
              <p class="intro">I usually use a mix of Julia, Python, and R during the exploratory phase of the consultation work, and I ask prospective clients to not restrict my software tools so that I can focus on solving the business problem. Please let me know at the start of a project if certain software tools are to be avoided.</p><br><br>

              <h2>The initial project assessment</h2>
              <p class="intro">After the initial consultation meeting but before accepting the actual project, I ask clients to fund a mini-project that acts as an initial assessment. This gives both myself and the client a chance to back out of the collaboration based the outcome of the assessment. By the end of this assessment, the client and I would identify the scope of my duties, have a few candidate work plans, and course-correction strategies should unexpected issues arise. After the initial assessment, we would start from the most promising work plan, and set up future assessments and milestones.</p>

                <h3>Scientific computing in Julia</h3>
                <p class="code-skill-description"><a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> is a programming language that has syntax like MATLAB and R, but could approach the runtime speed of C. <a href="https://juliacomputing.com/case-studies/">It is used by engineers, economists, and system biologists</a>. It is now bundled with the latest <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Lab</a>. Julia natively interfaces with C, and Julia libraries can be called from Python and R. The converse is also true; I frequently call Python and R libraries from Julia in my projects.<br><br>
                    
                    I have been using Julia since 2013, and follow best coding practices and professional software design patterns that are accepted in the Julia development community. I have experience with writing Julia in combination with Python in Jupyter notebooks, <a href="https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl">Pluto notebooks</a> (interactive notebooks), low-complexity web apps and REST APIs. I also do custom Julia/Python software library development, and wrapper library development in Python or R to a target Julia library.</p>
